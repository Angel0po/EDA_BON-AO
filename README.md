### 1. Project Overview
Briefly describe the purpose and motivation of this EDA project. Explain why this dataset is interesting or important to analyze.

This exploratory data analysis practices one's ability to code, clean data, visualize data, & data analysis. We are tasked to do the exploratory data analysis on the most streamed songs of Spotify 2023, which had source data anomalies, including wrong datatypes, missing values, and duplicated values. This is the reason why this dataset is suitable for data analysis, as it hones one's skill in various areas when executing the EDA.

### 2. Dataset Description
The origin of the dataset comes from Kaggle, a famous data science competition platform, and online community for data scientists and machine learning practitioners under Google LLC.
  https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/6367938
  
This dataset contains a comprehensive list of the most famous songs of 2023 as listed on Spotify. The dataset offers a wealth of features beyond what is typically available in similar datasets. It provides insights into each song's attributes, popularity, and presence on various music platforms (Elgiriyewithana, 2023).

### 3. Task Goals
- Practice cleaning data/ data preparation
- Analyze and visualize the cleaned data
- Explore relationships and gain insights from the different attributes of the dataset

---

### 4. Installation and Setup

- **Requirements**
  Install the following Python libraries:
  
     `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  
     `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
  
     `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization.
  
     `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  
- **Environment**:
  This notebook was developed using Python 3.x.
  
- **How to Run**:
  Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. If you donâ€™t have Jupyter installed, you can install it with: `pip install jupyter`
  After the notebook opens, execute each cell sequentially to run the analysis.

### 5. Data Exploration

#### Loading the Data
```python 
df_spotify = pd.read_csv('spotify-2023.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-1')
```
This line code loads the dataset and stores it into a data frame named "df_spotify". The read_csv is used to read csv files as a dataframe

#### Initial Observations
For initial observation, this line of code was used:
```python
df_spotify.info()
```
It gets the basic information of dataset including its size, attributes, and data type per attribute. The output looks like this:

  - Shape of the dataset (number of rows and columns)
  - Data types of each column
  - Presence of any missing values
